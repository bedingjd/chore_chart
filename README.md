# chore_chart
simple project to track the kids chores.
This is based loosely on [DinkyDash](https://github.com/caspii/dinkydash).
- For example, the images are from the DinkyDash repo
- Also, the design idea to use YAML for the data in order to permit others to use the project,
even if they have no programming experience.

>[!WARNING]
>This is still under development, and not yet working


# First Time Set-up
set up python virtual environment
as described [here](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv)
```
  mkdir venv
  python -m venv venv
  // virtualenv venv   (activated virtual environment)
  source venv/bin/activate
```

First time only:
- Installed pre-reqs:
  - `pip install flask`
  - `pip install pyyaml`
  - `pip install jinja2`
  - `pip install markdown`

- Other pre-reqs:
  - Install emoji fonts
    - `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`

- Other pre-reqs not yet installed:
  - Install unclutter to hide mouse: `sudo apt-get install unclutter -y`
  - To turn the screen orientation by 180Â° enter this on a new line in `/boot/config.txt` 
and the screen will turn upside-down after a reboot: `lcd_rotate=2`

# To Run Each Time (start)
- Open python virtual environment.  From outside `venv` folder:
  - `python -m venv venv`
  - `source venv/bin/activate`
- cd into `chore_chart` folder
- `./run_app.sh` 
- Open a browser and navigate to the chore chart at `http://192.168.1.234:5000`

# Notes
- New font icons to include in the config.yaml file can be found here: `https://symbolsdb.com/`

# To-Do
- [ ] convert dict to yaml: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52762525/convert-python-dictionary-to-yaml`
- [ ] Align the chort chart into a grid with one person per row
- [ ] Adjust the header, or remove the header and add a Chore Chart title
- [ ] Update the `update` button, or allow the entire Card to be a link to update chore status

- [ ] Update the chore status to a python `Enum` or enumeration
- [ ] Add capability to pay-out monies and adjust bank accounts
